# RepositoryUnitOfWork
An ASP..NET C# web mvc application demonstrates using repository and unit of work patterns in Entity Framework Core.

## The Repository Pattern
we are able to create the data access logic in a separate class, called a Repository, which has the responsibility of persisting the applicationâ€™s business model.

## The Unit of Work Pattern
The Unit of Work Pattern is a pattern that handles the transactions during data manipulation using the Repository Pattern. Unit of Work is referred to as a single transaction that involves multiple operations.
